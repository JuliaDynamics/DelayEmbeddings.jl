    pecuzal_embedding(s; kwargs...) → Y, τ_vals, ts_vals, ΔLs, ⟨ε★⟩
A unified approach to properly embed a timeseries or a set of timeseries
(`Dataset`) based on the recent PECUZAL algorithm due to Kraemer et al.[^Kraemer2021].

For more details, see the description below.

## Keyword arguments
* `τs = 0:50`: Possible delay values `τs` (in sampling time units). For each of
  the `τs`'s the continuity statistic ⟨ε★⟩ gets computed and further processed
  in order to find optimal delays `τᵢ` for each embedding cycle `i`.
* `w::Int = 0`: Theiler window (neighbors in time with index `w` close to the point,
  that are excluded from being true neighbors). `w=0` means to exclude only the
  point itself, and no temporal neighbors.
* `samplesize::Real = 1.0`: Fraction of state space points
  to be considered (fiducial points v) to average ε★ over, in order to
  produce `⟨ε★⟩`. Lower fraction value decreases accuracy as well as computation time.
* `K::Int = 13`: the amount of nearest neighbors in the δ-ball (read algorithm
  description). Must be at least 8 (in order to gurantee a valid statistic).
  `⟨ε★⟩` is computed taking the minimum result over all `k ∈ K`.
* `KNN::Int = 3`: the amount of nearest neighbors considered, in order to compute
  σ_k^2 (read algorithm description [`uzal_cost`]@ref). If given a vector, the
  minimum result over all `knn ∈ KNN` is returned.
* `L_threshold::Real = 0`: The algorithm breaks, when this threshold is exceeded
  by `ΔL` in an embedding cycle (set as a positive number, i.e. an absolute value
  of `ΔL`).
* `α::Real = 0.05`: The significance level for obtaining the continuity statistic
* `p::Real = 0.5`: The p-parameter for the binomial distribution used for the
  computation of the continuity statistic ⟨ε★⟩.
* `max_cycles = 50`: The algorithm will stop after that many cycles no matter what.
* `econ::Bool = false`: Economy-mode for L-statistic computation. Instead of
  computing L-statistics for time horizons `2:Tw`, here we only compute them for
  `2:2:Tw`, see description for further details.
* `verbose = true`: Print information about the process.

## Description
The method works iteratively and gradually builds the final embedding vectors
`Y`. Based on the `⟨ε★⟩`-statistic (of [`pecora`](@ref)) the algorithm picks an
optimal delay value `τᵢ` for each embedding cycle `i`.
For achieving that, we take the inpute time series `s`, denoted as the actual
phase space trajectory `Y_actual` and compute the continuity statistic `⟨ε★⟩`.

1. Each local maxima in `⟨ε★⟩` is used for constructing a
   candidate embedding trajectory `Y_trial` with a delay corresponding to that
   specific peak in `⟨ε★⟩`.
2. We then compute the `L`-statistic (of [`uzal_cost`](@ref))
   for `Y_trial` (`L-trial`) and `Y_actual` (`L_actual`) for increasing prediction
   time horizons (free parameter in the `L`-statistic) and save the maximum
   difference `max(L-trial - L_actual)` as `ΔL` (Note that this is a
   negative number, since the `L`-statistic decreases with better reconstructions).
3. We pick the `τ`-value, for which `ΔL` is minimal (=maximum decrease of
   the overall `L`-value) and construct the actual embedding trajectory
   `Y_actual` (steps 1.-3. correspond to an embedding cycle).
4. We repeat steps 1.-3. with `Y_actual` as input and stop the algorithm when `ΔL` is > 0,
   i.e. when and additional embedding component would not lead to a lower overall
   L-value. `Y_actual` -> `Y`.

In case of multivariate embedding, i.e. when embedding a set of M time series
(`s::Dataset`), in each embedding cycle the continuity statistic `⟨ε★⟩` gets
computed for all M time series available. The optimal delay value `τ` in each
embedding cycle is chosen as the peak/`τ`-value for which `ΔL` is
minimal under all available peaks and under all M `⟨ε★⟩`'s. In the first
embedding cycle there will be M² different `⟨ε★⟩`'s to consider, since it is
not clear a priori which time series of the input should consitute the first
component of the embedding vector and form `Y_actual`.

The range of considered delay values is determined in `τs` and for the
nearest neighbor search we respect the Theiler window `w`. The final embedding
vector is stored in `Y` (`Dataset`). The chosen delay values for each embedding
cycle are stored in `τ_vals` and the according time series numbers chosen for
each delay value in `τ_vals` are stored in `ts_vals`. For univariate embedding
(`s::Vector`) `ts_vals` is a vector of ones of length `τ_vals`, because there is
simply just one timeseries to choose from. The function also returns the
`ΔLs`-values for each embedding cycle and the continuity statistic `⟨ε★⟩`
as an `Array` of `Vector`s.

For distance computations the Euclidean norm is used.
