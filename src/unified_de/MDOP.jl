    mdop_embedding(s::Vector; kwargs...) → Y, τ_vals, ts_vals, FNNs, βS
MDOP (for "maximizing derivatives on projection") is a unified approach to properly
embed a timeseries or a set of timeseries (`Dataset`)
based on the paper of Chetan Nichkawde [^Nichkawde2013].

## Keyword arguments

* `τs= 0:50`: Possible delay values `τs`. For each of
  the `τs`'s the β-statistic gets computed.
* `w::Int = 1`: Theiler window (neighbors in time with index `w` close to the point,
  that are excluded from being true neighbors). `w=0` means to exclude only the
  point itself, and no temporal neighbors.
* `fnn_thres::Real= 0.05`: A threshold value defining a sufficiently small fraction
  of false nearest neighbors, in order to the let algorithm terminate and stop
  the embedding procedure (`0 ≤ fnn_thres < 1).
* `r::Real = 2`: The threshold for the tolerable relative increase of the distance
  between the nearest neighbors, when increasing the embedding dimension.
* `max_num_of_cycles = 50`: The algorithm will stop after that many cycles no matter what.

## Description
The method works iteratively and gradually builds the final embedding `Y`.
Based on the [`beta_statistic`](@ref) the algorithm picks an optimal delay
value `τ` for each embedding cycle as the global maximum of `β`. In case of
multivariate embedding, i.e. when embedding a set of time series (`s::Dataset`),
the optimal delay value `τ` is chosen as the maximum from all maxima's of all
considered `β`-statistics for each possible timeseries. The range of
considered delay values is determined in `τs` and for the nearest neighbor
search we respect the Theiler window `w`.

After each embedding cycle the FNN-statistic `FNNs` [^Hegger1999][^Kennel1992] is being
checked and as soon as this statistic drops below the threshold `fnn_thres`,
the algorithm terminates. In order to increase the practability of the method the
algorithm also terminates when the FNN-statistic `FNNs` increases.

The final embedding is returned as `Y`. The chosen delay values for each embedding
cycle are stored in the `τ_vals` and the according timeseries index chosen for the
the respective according delay value in `τ_vals` is stored in `ts_vals`.
`βS, FNNs` are returned for clarity and double-checking, since they are computed anyway.
In case of multivariate embedding, `βS` will store all `β`-statistics for all
available time series in each embedding cycle. To double-check the actual used
`β`-statistics in an embedding cycle 'k', simply `βS[k][:,ts_vals[k+1]]`.

    beta_statistic(Y::Dataset, s::Vector) [, τs, w]) → β
Compute the β-statistic `β` for input state space trajectory `Y` and a timeseries `s`
according to Nichkawde [^Nichkawde2013], based on estimating derivatives on a
projected manifold. For a range of delay values `τs`, `β` gets computed and its
maximum over all considered `τs` serves as the optimal delay considered in this
embedding cycle.

Arguments `τs, w` as in [`mdop_embedding`](@ref).

## Description
The `β`-statistic is based on the geometrical idea of maximal unfolding of the
reconstructed attractor and is tightly related to the False Nearest Neighbor
method ([^Kennel1992]). In fact the method eliminates the maximum amount of
false nearest neighbors in each embedding cycle. The idea is to estimate the
absolute value of the directional derivative with respect to a possible new
dimension in the reconstruction process, and with respect to the nearest
neighbor, for all points of the state space trajectory:

ϕ'(τ) = Δϕ_d(τ) / Δx_d

Δx_d is simply the Euclidean nearest neighbor distance for a reference point
with respect to the given Theiler window `w`. Δϕ_d(τ) is the distance of the
reference point to its nearest neighbor in the one dimensional time series `s`,
for the specific τ. Δϕ_d(τ) = |s(i+τ)-s(j+τ)|, with i being the index of the
considered reference point and j the index of its nearest neighbor.

Finally,

`β` = log β(τ) = ⟨log₁₀ ϕ'(τ)⟩ ,

with ⟨.⟩ being the mean over all reference points. When one chooses the maximum
of `β` over all considered τ's, one obtains the optimal delay value for this
embedding cycle. Note that in the first embedding cycle, the input state space
trajectory `Y` can also be just a univariate time series.

Compute an upper bound for the search of optimal delays, when using `mdop_embedding`
[`mdop_embedding`](@ref) or `beta_statistic` [`beta_statistic`](@ref).

## Description
The input time series `s` gets embedded with unit lag and increasing dimension,
for dimensions (or time windows) `tw` (`RangeObject`).
For each of such a time window the `L`-statistic from Uzal et al. [^Uzal2011]
will be computed. `samplesize` determines the fraction of points to be
considered in the computation of `L` (see [`uzal_cost`](@ref)). When this
statistic reaches its global minimum the maximum delay value `τ_max` gets
returned. When `s` is a multivariate `Dataset`, `τ_max` will becomputed for all
timeseries of that Dataset and the maximum value will be returned. The returned
`L`-statistic has size `(length(tw), size(s,2))`.
