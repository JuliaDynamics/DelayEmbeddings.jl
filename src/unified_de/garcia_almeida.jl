"""
    garcia_almeida_embedding(s; kwargs...) → Y, τ_vals, ts_vals, FNNs ,NS
A unified approach to properly embed a time series (`Vector` type) or a
set of time series (`Dataset` type) based on the papers of Garcia & Almeida
[^Garcia2005a],[^Garcia2005b].

## Keyword arguments

* `τs= 0:50`: Possible delay values `τs` (in sampling time units). For each of
  the `τs`'s the N-statistic gets computed.
* `w::Int = 1`: Theiler window (neighbors in time with index `w` close to the point,
  that are excluded from being true neighbors). `w=0` means to exclude only the
  point itself, and no temporal neighbors.
* `r1 = 10`: The threshold, which defines the factor of tolerable stretching for
  the d_E1-statistic.
* `r2 = 2`: The threshold for the tolerable relative increase of the distance
  between the nearest neighbors, when increasing the embedding dimension.
* `fnn_thres= 0.05`: A threshold value defining a sufficiently small fraction
  of false nearest neighbors, in order to the let algorithm terminate and stop
  the embedding procedure (`0 ≤ fnn_thres < 1).
* `T::Int = 1`: The forward time step (in sampling units) in order to compute the
  `d_E2`-statistic (see algorithm description). Note that in the paper this is
  not a free parameter and always set to `T=1`.
* `metric = Euclidean()`: metric used for finding nearest neigbhors in the input
  phase space trajectory `Y`.
* `max_num_of_cycles = 50`: The algorithm will stop after that many cycles no matter what.


## Description
The method works iteratively and gradually builds the final embedding vectors
`Y`. Based on the `N`-statistic the algorithm
picks an optimal delay value `τ` for each embedding cycle as the first local
minimum of `N`. In case of multivariate embedding, i.e. when embedding a set of
time series (`s::Dataset`), the optimal delay value `τ` is chosen as the first
minimum from all minimum's of all considered `N`-statistics for each embedding
cycle. The range of considered delay values is determined in `τs` and for the
nearest neighbor search we respect the Theiler window `w`. After each embedding
cycle the FNN-statistic `FNNs` [^Hegger1999][^Kennel1992] is being checked and
as soon as this statistic drops below the threshold `fnn_thres`, the algorithm
breaks. In order to increase the  practability of the method the algorithm also
breaks, when the FNN-statistic `FNNs` increases . The final embedding vector is
stored in `Y` (`Dataset`). The chosen delay values for each embedding cycle are
stored in the `τ_vals` and the according time series number chosen for the
according delay value in `τ_vals` is stored in `ts_vals`. For univariate
embedding (`s::Vector`) `ts_vals` is a vector of ones of length `τ_vals`,
because there is simply just one time series to choose from. The function also
returns the `N`-statistic `NS` for each embedding cycle as an `Array` of
`Vector`s.

Notice that we were *not* able to reproduce the figures from the papers with our
implementation (which nevertheless we believe is the correct one).

## core: Garcia-Almeida-method for one arbitrary embedding cycle

"""
    n_statistic(Y, s; kwargs...) → N, d_E1
Perform one embedding cycle according to the method proposed in [^Garcia2005a]
for a given phase space trajectory `Y` (of type `Dataset`) and a time series `s
(of type `Vector`). Return the proposed N-Statistic `N` and all nearest
neighbor distances `d_E1` for each point of the input phase space trajectory
`Y`. Note that `Y` is a single time series in case of the first embedding cycle.

## Keyword arguments
* `τs= 0:50`: Considered delay values `τs` (in sampling time units). For each of
  the `τs`'s the N-statistic gets computed.
* `r = 10`: The threshold, which defines the factor of tolerable stretching for
  the d_E1-statistic (see algorithm description).
* `T::Int = 1`: The forward time step (in sampling units) in order to compute the
  `d_E2`-statistic (see algorithm description). Note that in the paper this is
  not a free parameter and always set to `T=1`.
* `w::Int = 0`: Theiler window (neighbors in time with index `w` close to the point,
  that are excluded from being true neighbors). `w=0` means to exclude only the
  point itself, and no temporal neighbors. Note that in the paper this is not
  a free parameter and always `w=0`.
* `metric = Euclidean()`: metric used for finding nearest neigbhors in the input
  phase space trajectory `Y`.

## Description
For a range of possible delay values `τs` one constructs a temporary embedding
matrix. That is, one concatenates the input phase space trajectory `Y` with the
`τ`-lagged input time series `s`. For each point on the temporary trajectory one
computes its nearest neighbor, which is denoted as the `d_E1`-statistic for a
specific `τ`. Now one considers the distance between the reference point and its
nearest neighbor `T` sampling units ahead and calls this statistic `d_E2`.
[^Garcia2005a] strictly use `T=1`, so they forward each reference point and its
corresponding nearest neighbor just by one (!) sampling unit. Here it is a free
parameter.

The `N`-statistic is then the fraction of `d_E2`/`d_E1`-pairs which exceed a
threshold `r`.

Plotted vs. the considered `τs`-values it is proposed to pick the `τ`-value for
this embedding cycle as the value, where `N` has its first local minimum.
