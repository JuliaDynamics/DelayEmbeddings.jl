    estimate_delay(s, method::String [, τs = 1:100]; kwargs...) -> τ

Estimate an optimal delay to be used in [`embed`](@ref).
The `method` can be one of the following:

* `"ac_zero"` : first delay at which the auto-correlation function becomes <0.
* `"ac_min"` : delay of first minimum of the auto-correlation function.
* `"mi_min"` : delay of first minimum of mutual information of `s` with itself
  (shifted for various `τs`).
  Keywords `nbins, binwidth` are propagated into [`selfmutualinfo`](@ref).
* `"exp_decay"` : [`exponential_decay_fit`](@ref) of the correlation function rounded
   to an integer (uses least squares on `c(t) = exp(-t/τ)` to find `τ`).
* `"exp_extrema"` : same as above but the exponential fit is done to the
  absolute value of the local extrema of the correlation function.

Both the mutual information and correlation function (`autocor`) are computed _only_
for delays `τs`. This means that the `min` methods can never return the first value
of `τs`!

The method `mi_min` is significantly more accurate than the others and also returns
good results for most timeseries. It is however the slowest method (but still quite fast!).

    selfmutualinfo(s, τs; kwargs...) → m

Calculate the mutual information between the time series `s` and itself
delayed by `τ` points for `τ` ∈ `τs`, using an _improvement_ of the method
outlined by Fraser & Swinney in[^Fraser1986].

## Description

The joint space of `s` and its `τ`-delayed image (`sτ`) is partitioned as a
rectangular grid, and the mutual information is computed from the joint and
marginal frequencies of `s` and `sτ` in the grid as defined in [1].
The mutual information values are returned in a vector `m` of the same length
as `τs`.

If any of the optional keyword parameters is given, the grid will be a
homogeneous partition of the space where `s` and `sτ` are defined.
The margins of that partition will be divided in a number of bins equal
to `nbins`, such that the width of each bin will be `binwidth`, and the range
of nonzero values of `s` will be in the centre. If only of those two parameters
is given, the other will be automatically calculated to adjust the size of the
grid to the area where `s` and `sτ` are nonzero.

If no parameter is given, the space will be partitioned by a recursive bisection
algorithm based on the method given in [1].

Notice that the recursive method of [1] evaluates the joint frequencies of `s`
and `sτ` in each cell resulting from a partition, and stops when the data points
are uniformly distributed across the sub-partitions of the following levels.
For performance and stability reasons, the automatic partition method implemented
in this function is only used to divide the axes of the grid, using the marginal
frequencies of `s`.
